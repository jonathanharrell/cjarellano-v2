Candidates running at every level need messaging that sticks. 

Over the past decade, I've worked with premier media agencies such as [Hardpin Media](https://www.hardpinmedia.com) and [AKPD](https://akpdmedia.com) to create compelling broadcast and digital ads for political candidates. See the video that kicked off [Becca Balint](https://vimeo.com/802797644/7014fb7255)'s winning campaign for the U.S. Congress on this page's featured panel. 

See also my work with [Joe Biden's presidential campaign](https://www.cjarellano.com/project/biden-for-president).

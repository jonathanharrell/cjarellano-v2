Candidates running at every level need messaging that sticks. 

Over the past decade, I've worked with premier media agencies [Hardpin Media](https://www.hardpinmedia.com) and [AKPD](https://akpdmedia.com) to create compelling broadcast and digital ads for heavy hitters such as Pete Buttigieg, Stacy Abrams, and Becca Balint.

I edited the video that kicked off Balint's winning congressional campaign, which you can view **[here](https://vimeo.com/802797644/7014fb7255)**.

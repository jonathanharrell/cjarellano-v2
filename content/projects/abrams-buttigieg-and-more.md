Candidates running at every level need messaging that sticks. 

Over the past decade, I've worked with premier media agencies such as Hardpin Media and AKPD Media to create compelling broadcast and digital ads for political candidates such as Stacy Abrams, Pete Buttigieg, and Becca Balint.

See the video that I edited, which kicked off Balint's winning campaign for the U.S. Congress [here](https://vimeo.com/802797644/7014fb7255).

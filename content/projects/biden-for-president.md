Joe Biden battled for the soul of the nation and won.

These videos, produced by [Hardpin Media](https://www.hardpinmedia.com), served as broadcast and digital messaging for the historic Biden for President campaign in the fall of 2020. A video piece that C.J. edited for the Committee to Protect Medicare to support Biden's campaign was featured in [AdWeek](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/this-somber-ad-about-bidens-family-tragedy-says-his-empathy-is-needed-in-the-white-house/).

She's all dressed down with nowhere to go.

In this comedic web series starring award-winning actress Julia DiFerdinando, a wayward woman makes a bold move and traps herself in the coat room of a party, hoping to entice her one true love. Instead, she keeps running into guests - one guest per episode - who just want to get their coats.

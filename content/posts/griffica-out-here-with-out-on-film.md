I'm thrilled to report that Out on Film: Atlanta's LGBTQ Film Festival awarded my film "Griffica" with the Audience Award for Best Horror Short!Â 

I sat down with the fest's programming director, Jim Farmer, and had a terrific time chatting about the trickiness of an unreliable narrator and what horror means to the queer community.

Check it out!

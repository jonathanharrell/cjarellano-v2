Oof. It’s hard out here for us Whovians. 

The Jodie Whittaker seasons have been flimsy at best, despite a talented cast who appear to yearn every week for material that can play to their strengths. Still, I watched "Revolution of the Daleks" with anticipatory glee: the latest *Doctor Who* special sees the beloved Captain Jack reunite with the Doctor in their latest scrap against the Daleks.

Showrunner Chris Chibnall continues to infuse the show with gorgeous production value, while (superficially) bolstering the franchise’s diversity and inclusion quotient. He also continues to dog the show with half-baked writing choices and an overall perfunctory vibe that leaves this once-innovative show seeming like it’s oh-so-bored with itself.

It’s a question that fans have asked at various fallow points in the show’s rocky six-decade history: Can the Doctor be saved?

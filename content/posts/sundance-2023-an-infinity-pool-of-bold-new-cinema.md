I was pumped to attend the first in-person [Sundance Film Festival](https://www.sundance.org) since the pandemique pushed it into online limbo back in 2020. 

I caught 11 films in flavors ranging from horror, sci-fi, to teen YA, and of course, coming-of-age dramedy. I counted but one true dud amongst a spate of thrilling new works. Roll on over to [The Artists' Forum](https://theartistsforum.org/film-2023-sundance-film-festival/) magazine to read [my piping hot takes on these films](https://theartistsforum.org/film-2023-sundance-film-festival/):

*The Pod Generation*

*Fairyland*

*Past Lives*

*Kokomo City*

*In My Mother's Skin*

*Mutt*

*Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I Feel Kinda Left Out*

*Rotting in the Sun*

*Shortcomings*

*Infinity Pool* (the horny NC-17 cut!)

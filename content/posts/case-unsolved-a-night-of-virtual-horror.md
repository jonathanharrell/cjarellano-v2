Many many thank you's to [Asian CineVision](https://www.asiancinevision.org) for selecting my screenplay "Case Unsolved" as the WINNER of the 43rd Asian-American International Film Festival's Screenplay Competition!

The [Sá»‘ng Collective](https://thesongcollectivenyc.org) theatre company staged an \*exquisite\* virtual reading of the script with a top-notch cast - directed with expert precision by Jeffrey Lo - who all understood the creepy, character-centric brand of horror that I had hoped to infuse into the screenplay. (Bonus: The stellar cast included the sweet + versatile Emily Kuroda, aka Lane's mom from *Gilmore Girls*. Ya boy was star-struck!) My heart is full. Maraming salamat to all who participated and watched!

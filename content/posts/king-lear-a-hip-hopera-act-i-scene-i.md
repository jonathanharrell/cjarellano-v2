I once wrote a heist screenplay in which the characters - as part of an elaborate ruse, of course - perform a hip-hopera version of *King Lear*. I've long toyed with the idea of developing this musical-within-a-movie into a bona fide project in its own right. Until then, here's the opening scene. Enjoy!

KING LEAR\
I'm the top motherfuckin' dog on my block\
Rule with an iron fist and an iron Glock\
Over all of Great Britain, my millions flock  \
I'm reaching old age; almost off the clock\
Throwin' in the towel\
Before me, Regan, Goneril\
And Cordelia; all them honorable\
Three shorties of the finest seed\
The finest breed\
In my hand, I hold the deed\
To the land I should divide\
And who should claim the largest side?\
I'll use who loves me greatest as my guide\
Goneril, the eldest, you begin\
And say how much you love me, it's a sin

GONERIL\
Sir, I love you more than my flow say\
Throw sight and space and liberty away\
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare\
The Cuts, the Cads, the Beamers, I don't care\
I'll starve when you die\
You're the gleam in my eye\
So handing me the biggest third is only fair 

CORDELIA\
*(sung)*\
What shall Cordelia do?\
Love and be silent and true

KING LEAR\
Girl, you know how to please your dad\
Here's what I give you; let that be that:\
From this line to this, I bestow my 'hood\
For you and Albany; son, treat her good\
And now onto Regan, Shorty Number Two\
Wifey to Cornwall; now, what sayeth you?

REGAN\
I'm made of dear Goneril's self-same spit\
So prize me at her worth; or even over it\
I find she names my very deed of love\
But she comes too short; see, I go above\
Father, I'm an enemy to all other joys\
Fuck the whips, the chains, the flimsy ass toys\
Fuck my boys, my bitches, and anybody's crew\
The entirety of my love's for you

CORDELIA\
*(sung)*\
What shall Cordelia do?\
Love and be silent and true

KING LEAR\
To thee and thine hereditary ever\
May you prosper with this ample third forever\
No less in space, validity, pleasure\
Than your sister's; now onto my finest treasure\
Shorty Number Three, Cordelia’s time\
She’ll dust these girls, she’ll murder their rhymes\
Don't keep me waiting; what say you? Speak.

CORDELIA\
Nothing, my lord. I've nothing you seek.

KING LEAR\
Nothing?

CORDELIA\
Nothing, I've nothing then.

KING LEAR\
Nothing yields nothing; speak again.

CORDELIA\
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave\
My heart to my mouth; so please believe\
That I know you've been nothing but good to me\
And I know that I seem like I shouldn't be\
It seems that I'll never be Goneril or Regan\
And just for the record; I know they're fakin'\
But I can't give the whole of my love to you\
If I say, then I'll know I ain't being true

KING LEAR\
Girl, I'm not sure that I'm feelin' you\
Girl, are you high? The fuck’s wrong with you!

CORDELIA\
Please, I'm your daughter--

KING LEAR\
Well, not anymore\
Please vacate your ass\
Let it hit not the door\
*(to Regan and Goneril)*\
Forget what I said!\
Let me make one amend!\
I'll half my land up\
One half per head!\
As for Cordy here\
I hope the pond turns red\
And some punkass fisherman finds her dead\
Kent, Gloucester, she's not worth an ounce\
I'm through with you Cordy; homes, let's bounce

*(King exits with entourage)*

REGAN\
The sooner he's ill, the sooner he's dead

GONERIL   \
O sister, my sister, we must plan ahead

CORDELIA\
Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides\
Who cover faults, at last shame them derides

\
*(All exit.)*

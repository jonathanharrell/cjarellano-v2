Are You Afraid of the Dark? has forever held its twisted claw around my horror-craving heart. So it goes for swaths of anxiety-addled millennials who grew up with this anthology creep-show that originally ran on Nickelodeon from 1991 to 1996. Every week a group of teenagers called the Midnight Society would meet in the middle of the woods to tell scary stories. And that was it - Twilight Zone for tweens.

I’ve been re-binging it lately, partly because the new Goosebumps on Disney+ pushed my brain back into the YA horror space, partly because I love to dissect horror narratives that can’t rely on blood or even a body count to thrill its audience, and partly because - dammit, REAL LIFE is stressful and it’s nice to crank up the nostalgia machine.  

Curious to reunite with the Midnight Society but not sure where to start? Or maybe you’ve never seen the show, and you’re wondering if it has any legit scare fare to offer? Read on for my list of the top 10 Are You Afraid of the Dark? episodes to ever haunt the Saturday night Snick lineup. These tales might not have Jigsaw’s blood-covered bear traps or Leatherface’s gnarly dinner parties. But they boast crackerjack storytelling, poignant coming-of-age character arcs, and - best of all - indelible horror imagery that would have many fully grown, tax-paying adults reaching for the light switch. 

Submitted for your approval (well… really my approval because it’s a list that reflects my personal tastes and preferences), I lazily call this list, “The Top 10 Best Are You Afraid of the Dark? Episodes.”

## 10. The Tale of the Crimson Clown

Insufferable Sam steals money from his responsible older brother Mike, who retaliates by making up a story about the Crimson Clown, punisher of naughty children. That night, the Crimson Clown comes to life and terrorizes Sam… for real!

The clown’s character design hits that perfect sweet spot between campy and all-out creepy. The degree to which he’s made of simple childlike shapes is full-tilt comical: the spherical head, diamond eyes, and semicircle mouth feel like they’re based on doodles from a 5-year-old’s handy-dandy notebook. But it’s disquieting how the clown’s face changes although we never see it move. And the sheer relentlessness with which he stalks the maybe-asleep Sam starts to feel like a Lynchian madhouse. Also in the divine creepy-meets-campy department: There’s something laugh-out-loud funny but also weirdly mean about the clown displaying a red “No” circle with Sam’s name crossed out. Sometimes the cruelest bullying tactics are the simplest.

I also have a fondness for the episodes that manage to lend decent character beats to the Midnight Society, even though we learn little about their lives during the three minutes of screen time they’re afforded each week.  In this episode, Gary tells the Crimson Clown story after his little brother Tucker wrongs him. The story causes Tucker to relent and apologize. It’s a fun use of the show’s wrap-around device, and it helps to mature the relationship between Gary and Tucker, an evolution that culminates in Tucker inheriting leadership of the group years later.

The Artists' Forum Festival of the Moving Image had their closing night awards ceremony last night, and I won Best Director for my short "Griffica"!

Here's my acceptance speech. I had to deliver it at the last minute, hence the handheld aesthetic and my super-casual Back to the Future holiday sweater:

<div class="relative mb-12" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0;">

    title="Video player" 
    class="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
    frameborder="0" 
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

"Griffica" also picked up nominations for Best Lead Actor (congrats to my dude James Dolbeare!), Best Screenplay, and Best Editing. 

Many many thanks to the fine folks at the Artists' Forum!
